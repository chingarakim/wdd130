    <p>Hello everyone. I have been a member of the church for almost a year and a half and so far i have loved it.
        This is because i have had the opportunity to meet such wonderful people and have learnt a lot from each 
        one of them.
    </p>I currently reside in Capetown South Africa. I have lived in Botswana and Zimbabwe throughtout 
    chiidhood.Capetown is such a lovely place with a lot to see and do especially if you love nature, mountains 
    or the ocean.
    <p>I love to read and learning new skills and cultures.I also dont know anything about web design but
      l trust that with time i will have a better idea.I look forward to getting to know you all and to
       working together
